Project: Data Cleaning of Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset (Excel)

As part of my data analysis practice, I worked on cleaning and preparing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using Microsoft Excel. Here are the key steps I performed:

Removed Duplicate Records

Identified and eliminated duplicate entries to ensure the dataset contained only unique records. This helped maintain data integrity and avoid repetition in analysis.

Handled Missing Values

Replaced blank or missing cells with the phrase “Not Available” to maintain consistency and make the data more interpretable during analysis.

Checked and Corrected Data Types

Reviewed the columns to ensure that text, dates, and numeric values were in their correct data formats. This step was crucial for accurate sorting, filtering, and further analysis.

Formatted Text Using Excel Formulas

Applied the PROPER function to columns with textual data (like Titles, Director ,Cast,Country) to standardize capitalization — making the dataset cleaner and more readable.

Converted Data into a Proper Table Format

Converted the cleaned dataset into an Excel Table to enable easier filtering, sorting, and application of formulas across columns efficiently.
